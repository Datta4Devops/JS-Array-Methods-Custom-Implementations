# JS-Array-Methods-Custom-Implementations
Let's understand the basics of JS and implement few higher order functions as a part of this exercise. You can read about what each of these function does and them try to write your logic for the same. Do not use inbuilt functions.
1. map
2. filter
3. reduce
4. forEach


Each of the above function takes 2 parameters. A list of numbers and a callback function that gets executed on the list.
